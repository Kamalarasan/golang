1) Create an optimized Dockerfile for our simple application

--> Dockerfile Created & Attached in Mail.
--> Image size without Optimization is 941MB & with Optimization 25.4MB(Snippet attached)
--> Refered https://docs.docker.com/
--> We can build with `docker build` command using Dockerfile.

==============================================================

2. Create a script 

--> Script attached in mail in the name of "git_script.sh"
--> Declared "branch_name" as variable.
--> This will perform git clone of the declared branch & build the docker image with the Dockerfile(cloned from git) & then it tags the image with branch_name(variable)
--> Here I use "gogit" as variable of "branch_name"

================================================================

3. Create a simple YAML deployment for our application with Livenessprobe feature.

--> I have attached 5 yaml files.(2 Deployment, 2 svc & 1 Ingress)
--> we can create golong with application feature by below mentioned steps.

	I) Create Namespace to Seperate application from Others
	
	# kubectl create namespace golang
	
	II) Create Deployments for golang(namespaces were mentioned in yaml)
	
	# kubectl create -f golang-simple-app-1-deploy.yaml
	# kubectl create -f golang-simple-app-data-deploy.yaml
	
	III) Check the Deployments Created
	
	# kubectl get pods -n golang
	
	IV) Create Services for golang(namespaces were mentioned in yaml)
	
	# kubectl create -f golang-simple-app-1-svc.yaml
	# kubectl create -f golang-simple-app-data-svc.yaml
	
	V) Check the services Created
	
	# kubectl get svc -n golang
	
	VI) Create Ingress
	
	# kubectl create -f ingress.yaml

--> Check the Application Reachability
